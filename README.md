# Digital Image Processing
This is a collection of assignments done using Matlab/OpenCV for my Image Processing course. Each folder consists of a PDF file specifying various problems, and the folder labeled "Solution" has my responses. 

Feel free to clone this repo and use it how ever you see fit.
